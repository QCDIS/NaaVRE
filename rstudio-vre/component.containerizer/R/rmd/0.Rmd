# Introduction

This is a long R Markdown document that includes multiple code snippets. We will go through several steps of a typical data analysis workflow.

# Load Libraries

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
```

# Data Loading

```{r}
# Load the built-in mtcars dataset data(mtcars)
```

# Data Cleaning

```{r}
# Check for missing values sum(is.na(mtcars))
```

# Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
# Summary of the dataset summary(mtcars)
```

# Data Visualization

```{r}
# Scatter plot of mpg vs. disp ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=disp, y=mpg)) + geom_point() + labs(title="Scatter plot of Miles Per Gallon vs. Displacement", x="Displacement", y="Miles Per Gallon")
```

# Conclusion

This is a simple example of a long R Markdown document with multiple code snippets. You can add more sections and code snippets as needed for your analysis.
